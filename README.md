ATM System
Overview
This project is a simple Java-based ATM simulation that allows users to perform basic banking tasks such as checking account balances, withdrawing or depositing money, and generating a mini-statement of recent transactions. The program simulates the behavior of an ATM machine through a command-line interface.

Features
PIN Verification: Users must enter a valid account number and PIN to access their account.
Account Selection: Users can choose to interact with either their checking or savings account.
Check Balance: Users can view the current balance of their selected account.
Withdraw and Deposit: Users can withdraw or deposit money, with changes immediately reflected in the balance.
Mini Statement: A record of recent transactions (withdrawals and deposits) is displayed.
How to Run
javac ATM.java
Run the program:
java com.atm.ATM
Enter the provided account number and PIN to begin.
Predefined Accounts
For testing, the program includes the following predefined accounts:

Account Number: 4281936507, PIN: 7321
Account Number: 5178920463, PIN: 4892
Conclusion
This ATM simulation is a basic implementation that demonstrates account management, PIN verification, and transaction tracking. It's useful for learning the fundamentals of banking operations and simple Java programming techniques.
